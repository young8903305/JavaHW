# JavaHW
##HW1:
    This homework requires you to define an enumeration type called
	BasicColor for the eight combinations of primary colors: BLACK, RED,
	BLUE, GREEN, CYAN, MAGENTA, YELLOW, and WHITE, each represented
	internally compactly as an int. In addition, you are required to
	implement also miscellaneous methods documented in the body.
  
##HW2:
  Table and PQueue and one generic method: minMax() given inside the class HW2.
  
##HW3:
  Implement all methods given in this class using lambda expressions.

##HW4:
  Given an input file named 'inFileName' and a result file named
	'outFileName', read bytes from the input file, convert each byte into its
	hexadecimal representation (which is a string of length 2 or 2
	characters) and write it to the result file. The named result file must
	be created if it does not exist before and its previous content must be
	cleared/truncated if it is an existing file.
  
##HW51:
  Rewrite the CubbyHoleprogram using lock and condition.
  
##HW52:
  1. Generalize the CubbyHoleprogram so that it allow 4 producers and 4 consumers.
  2. The cube hole can hold at most 2 pairs of numbers.
  3. Every pair of numbers put by a producer must be consumed exactly once by a producer.
  4. The consumer must wait if there is no pair of number in the CubbyHoleand the producer must wait if the cubbyHoleis full 
  (has 2 pairs).
  5. It doesn’t require that numbers put first must be got first.

##HW53:
  1. Using an ArrayBlockingQueue to rewrite the HW52
  2. The queue can hold at most 2 pairs of numbers.
  3. Every pair of numbers put by a producer must be consumed exactly once by a producer.
  4. The consumer must wait if there is no pair of number in the CubbyHoleand the producer must wait if the cubbyHoleis full 
  (has 2 pairs).
  5. It doesn’t require that numbers put first must be got first.
